## What is This?

This repo serves as the source code for my personal site, [seanclayton.me]

[seanclayton.me]: https://seanclayton.me

## Why Open Source?

I learned a lot about web development through `Right-Click -> View Source` and because of the natural openness of the web, my life changed forever. Open-source repositories, such as this one, can only help the next generation of developers and I can only hope I help someone change their life as well. :heart:

## Colophon

Most of the tools used to make this site are open-source software, and those that aren't almost always have some great open-source alternative.
