## A Series of Thoughts, Questions, and Answers on the Subject of Technology-driven Human Evolution

- - -

The User-Experience (UX) and User-Interface (UI) fields seem like they are at an all-time high today. With the sheer amount of the possible devices we can interact with (like smartphones, tablets, watches, automobiles, etcâ€¦) it is easy to come to that conclusion. We have amazing designers innovating the way humans communicate with technology and these innovations grow in number each and every day. I feel, though, that the way we perceive UX and UI today will not be the same in the future.

In this series of writings I am going to explore the quite possible future of humans and our technology, focusing on the former's interaction with the latter. I will also answer the following question: How do we evolve humanity through technology and design? Specifically, I will be covering the following topics:

1. What is the ideal solution to human interfacing?
2. How will we get there?
3. Possible outcomes

The reason I am writing this piece is simply because I feel that not enough people truly see the possibilities of technology. I've read and heard many discussions regarding the current state of communication, entertainment, education, and other fields, stating that they are plateauing in innovation and advancement. That conclusion is _simply wrong_. Connecting people through these fields has just started to reach any amount of real momentum, and to think otherwise is missing a much larger picture of human-oriented design and its goals. There are people who agree with my opinion and have voiced it, but a common trait amongst that crowd is they have no possible solutions. Not many people share my opinion on how we can utilize technology to improve humanity, but that may be because I haven't voiced it anywhere. This series will change that.

In Part 1 I will discuss and entertain ideas surrounding answering the question: "What is the perfect human interface?"
